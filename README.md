A curated collection of tools and configs that power my daily workflow.
#### 🌀 Lazygit

 * A simple, fast, and powerful Git UI for the terminal.

#### 🐟 Fish Shell

 * My interactive shell for a smooth terminal experience, with fzf wired in for fuzzy finding and bat-powered previews. See [fish config](.config/fish/README.md) for plugins, shortcuts, and custom functions.
 * Machine-local environment variables (not committed to dotfiles) go in `~/.config/fish/conf.d/local-env.fish` — fish sources everything in `conf.d/` automatically.

#### 👻 Ghostty

 * My terminal of choice — modern, GPU-accelerated, and lightning fast.
 * Run `ghostty-help` for a searchable fzf picker of all Ghostty actions and their keybindings.
 * `⌘+click` any file path or URL in the terminal to open it — files open in Neovide, URLs open in the default browser. Inside tmux, use `⌘+shift+click` since tmux captures mouse events.

#### 📟 Tmux

 * Terminal multiplexer with dual Catppuccin themes, custom status bar, and Neovim-friendly keybindings. See [tmux config](.config/tmux/README.md).

#### 📝 Neovim

 * My main editor — lightweight yet powerful. See [nvim-v12](.config/nvim-v12/README.md) for my custom 0.12 config built on the native `vim.pack` plugin manager.

#### 📂 Superfile

 * A modern, terminal file manager.

#### 🛠 Mise

 * Runtime version manager for Node, Bun, Python, uv, Go, Rust, and Lua — per-project version pinning via `.mise.toml`.

#### 🤖 Claude Code

 * AI coding assistant with a custom statusline, vim mode, and diff review popup. See [claude config](.config/claude/README.md) for the full setup.

#### 📖 Glow

 * Terminal markdown renderer — pipe or point at any `.md` file for formatted output with layout and syntax highlighting.
 * Quick Look integration via `qlmarkdown` cask — spacebar in Finder renders markdown in place.

#### 📺 Television

 * A fast, extensible fuzzy finder TUI for files, commands, git objects, and custom sources.

#### 💻 Fastfetch

 * For showing off system info in style — with random ASCII art and a pacman color row.
